# TN-Education-Landscape
Python, Excel, SQL and Powerbi .T Capstone for DA14 looking at factors shaping student performance based on data from TN education department.

Data Question
1) How does student performance, measured by proficiency in various subjects, vary across Tennessee's districts? How does this trend vary for different demographic groups? (race, sex, age, language, population density)
2) How does students' behavior, like discipline and attendance, relate to their performance?
3) How do the school staffâ€™s experience and impulse responses relate to their students' performance?
4) Does crime prevalence affect students' performance?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The target audience for this project is policymakers and parents. For the policymakers, I plan to prepare a presentation outlining the data questions at hand, the methods deployed, and the findings through chats and descriptions.
For parents and students selecting a district, I plan to prepare an interactive dashboard that can be used to predict the performance of a student based on relevant metrics.
