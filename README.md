# **TN Education Landscape**

Capstone Project for DA14
Exploring tends of student achievement in the state of Tennessee from 2021 to 2024 and analyzing key factors influencing student achievement using data from the Tennessee Department of Education.


## 📂 **Data Sources**
1)  **Tennessee Department of Education:** 
- Student assessment, discipline, attendance, educator count, and educator experience data
[TN Department of Education Data Download and Requests](https://www.tn.gov/education/districts/federal-programs-and-oversight/data/data-downloads.html)
2)  **Tennessee Bureau of Investigation:**
[Crime Rates](https://crimeinsight.tbi.tn.gov/public/View/dispview.aspx?ReportId=20)
3)  **Tennessee Demographics:**
[Population Density](https://www.tennessee-demographics.com/counties_by_population)
4)  **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED):**
[Mean Household Income](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=268584&rid=175)

## ❓ **Key Questions**
1)  How does student performance—measured by achievement rate—vary across Tennessee school districts?
- How do trends differ by student subgroups over the 2021–2022 academic year?
2)  What is the relationship between student behavior (e.g., discipline incidents, attendance) and academic performance?
4)  How do educator factors—such as experience levels, student-teacher ratio, retention rate, and percentage living in poverty—correlate with student achievement?
5)  Do broader county-level conditions (crime rate, household income, population density) influence district-level student performance?
