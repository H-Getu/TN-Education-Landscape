## **Key Questions**
1)  How does student performance—measured by achievement rate—vary across Tennessee school districts?
- How do trends differ by student subgroups over the 2021–2022 academic year?
2)  What is the relationship between student behavior (e.g., discipline incidents, attendance) and academic performance?
4)  How do educator factors—such as experience levels, student-teacher ratio, retention rate, and percentage living in poverty—correlate with student achievement?
5)  Do broader county-level conditions (crime rate, household income, population density) influence district-level student performance?

## **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
1)  **Data Storytelling:**
- A structured presentation outlining key questions, methods, and findings using charts, summaries, and insights.
